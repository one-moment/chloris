## Current Goal

Build Chloris into an internal communication and work automation platform.

The current priority is Purchase Agent stabilization:
- employees can request purchases naturally in the chat tool
- Purchase Agent structures requests into editable drafts
- approved drafts are split into vendor-specific tasks
- Coupang tasks can be queued for the local purchase worker
- final payment remains human-reviewed

## In progress — Inventory (입고·폐기) module (Ralph loop, started 2026-06-15)

Building the flower stock-in + disposal module (`docs/inventory-stockin-disposal.md`, spec confirmed
2026-06-15) via the Ralph loop. Runbook OBJECTIVE in `ralph/PROMPT.md` repointed at this work; loop
completion promise = `RALPH-DONE` (max_iterations 30 safety cap). One bounded step per iteration on
`feature/purchase-bot-mvp`. Six phases: ①data model ②master+lookup APIs ③disposal form ④stock-in+OCR
⑤sheet sync+import ⑥metrics.

Key confirmed decisions (doc §3): Chloris = system of record; lot-cost tracking with 4-day
auto-lot-mapping (daily fresh-flower price variance); category fixed 3 (기타/제작폐기_꽃다발/제작폐기_오늘의꽃);
item-name validation gate + "신규 품목 등록 요청" approval; 임시저장/최종제출; one-way sync to a NEW
Google Sheet (existing sheet untouched); import past lots+disposals so past disposals link to past lots.

- Iteration 1 (done): spec doc `docs/inventory-stockin-disposal.md` + repointed `ralph/PROMPT.md`
  OBJECTIVE + set loop completion promise. No code/schema change yet (docs only → repo stays green).
- Iteration 2 (done, Phase 1): six models added to BOTH schemas (`FlowerItem`, `DisposalCause`,
  `StockInDelivery`/`StockInLine` with unique `lotId`, `DisposalBatch`/`DisposalLine`, `NewItemRequest`)
  + hand-written migration `20260615140000_add_inventory_module`. **NOT applied to prod** (`.env` →
  Boro prod; needs approval). Scalar cross-module ids, intra-module FK (delivery→line, batch→line,
  ON DELETE CASCADE); money=Int(원), quantity=Float(소수). Both schemas `prisma validate` ✓,
  `generate` ✓, `npm run lint` ✓ (module boundaries ok).
- Iteration 3 (done, Phase 2a): module skeleton. `modules/inventory/index.js` (manifests
  `disposalModule` slug disposal→/work/disposal, `stockInModule` slug stockin→/work/stock-in)
  registered in `modules/registry.js`; brand gating in `lib/brand.js` (borough += disposal, stockin);
  route pages `app/(workspace)/work/disposal|stock-in/page.jsx` with `isModuleEnabled` guard; stub
  dashboards (`modules/inventory/ui/DisposalDashboard|StockInDashboard.jsx`). `npm run lint` +
  `next build` pass (both routes compile static, sidebar nav renders them).
- Iteration 4 (done, Phase 2b): lookup/validation APIs + `lib/inventory.js` (constants:
  `DISPOSAL_CATEGORIES` 3-fixed, `DEFAULT_LOT_WINDOW_DAYS=4`). `GET /api/work/inventory/items?q=`
  (autocomplete + `exactMatch` for save-gate), `/reasons` (fixed categories + active causes),
  `/lots?item=&date=&window=` (same-item lots in [date-N, date], newest first — 4-day auto-mapping).
  Auth + brand guard + missing-table degrade-to-empty. `npm run lint` + `next build` pass (3 routes register).
- Iteration 5 (done, Phase 2c-1): master CRUD write APIs (admin-gated, `user.role==="admin"`).
  `GET/POST /api/work/inventory/admin/items` + `PATCH .../items/[itemId]` (name dup-check, 활성여부);
  `GET/POST .../admin/causes` + `PATCH .../causes/[causeId]`. Auth+admin+degrade. lint+build pass.
- Iteration 6 (done, Phase 2c-2): `NewItemRequest` API. `POST /api/work/inventory/item-requests`
  (member; dedups vs existing item + pending request), `GET` (admin, status filter),
  `PATCH .../[requestId]` (admin: approve→find-or-create FlowerItem + link / reject). Degrade. lint+build pass.
- Iteration 7 (done, Phase 2c-3): admin master UI. `inventoryMasterModule` (slug inventory-master,
  nav minRole admin → /work/inventory/masters) + route page + `modules/inventory/ui/
  InventoryMastersDashboard.jsx` (client): pending 신규 품목 요청 승인/반려, 품목 마스터 추가/활성토글,
  폐기원인 마스터 추가/활성토글. Consumes admin + item-requests APIs. lint+build pass.
  **Phase 2 COMPLETE** (skeleton + lookup/validation + master management).
- Iteration 8 (done, Phase 3-1): disposal write API + `lib/inventoryServer.js` (prisma helpers:
  serialize/resolveLotPrices/buildLineData/validateForSubmit, shared by routes — boundary-safe core lib).
  `POST /api/work/inventory/disposals` (draft|submitted; **server validation gate** → 422 on any line
  error, no save; lot unitPrice snapshot → amount=round(price*qty)), `GET` (list, branch/status/date
  filters), `GET/PATCH .../[batchId]` (resume draft: replace lines + draft→submitted transition in a
  tx; submitted records locked). Degrade. lint+build pass.
- Iteration 9 (done, Phase 3-2): disposal form UI (`DisposalDashboard.jsx` now a full form, replaces
  stub). Table grid; Enter=next cell / last-cell Enter=new row (IME-safe via `nativeEvent.isComposing`);
  품목 combobox (`/items`, debounced, free-input); 구분/폐기원인 dropdowns (`/reasons`); 지점·폐기일 header
  (branches from `disposals` GET); 임시저장(POST draft → keeps batchId)/최종제출(PATCH submitted);
  server 422 errors shown per-row (red) + list; 엑셀 복사(TSV clipboard). `apiClient` now attaches
  `.status`+`.data` to thrown errors (for 422 body); `.work-suggest`/cell-input CSS added. lint+build pass.
- Iteration 11 (done, Phase 3-3): lot picker in the disposal form. Picking an item from the combobox
  auto-fetches `/lots?item=&date=` and preselects the newest lot (4-day auto-mapping); 출처(lot) column
  shows unitPrice + 변경/해제, popover lists candidates (날짜·거래처·단가·D-n, newest=추천) + 출처 없음.
  Lot mapping clears when item text changes. unitPrice flows to server → 폐기가액 snapshot. **Phase 3 DONE.**
  lint+build pass.
- Iteration 12 (done, Phase 4-1): stock-in write API + server helpers (`lotDatePrefix`, `buildLotId`
  = `YYYYMMDD_품목_거래처_NNNN` continuing the day's running seq, `stockInLineStatus` 3-way →
  ok/discrepancy/missing/substitute, `serializeStockInDelivery`). `POST /api/work/inventory/stock-ins`
  (draft|submitted, lotId auto-number, amount=round(price×실입고), totalAmount), `GET` (list + branches).
  Degrade. lint+build pass.
- Iteration 13 (done, Phase 4-2): stock-in form UI (`StockInDashboard.jsx` full form replaces stub).
  Table 품목/발주/영수증/실입고/단가/특이사항; 품목 combobox; Enter/last-cell→new-row (IME-safe);
  client 3-way preview (`rowStatus` mirrors server) → row highlight + 상태 chip (일치/불일치/미입고/대체);
  지점·거래처·입고일 header; 입고 등록(POST submitted → lotId auto-number); 엑셀 복사; 입고가액 합계.
  lint+build pass.
- Iteration 14 (done, Phase 4-3a): 거래명세서 OCR backend. `extractStatementLineItems({imageUrl})` in
  `lib/agents/openaiClient.js` (Vision via OpenAI Responses API input_image; `OPENAI_VISION_MODEL`/
  `OPENAI_AGENT_MODEL`; returns skipped/parseError/result). `POST /api/work/inventory/stock-ins/ocr`
  → normalized `{ degraded, supplier, statementDate, lines }`. No key / API error / parse fail →
  `degraded:true` + empty lines (form falls back to manual). lint+build pass.
- Iteration 15 (done, Phase 4-3b): OCR wired into stock-in form. "거래명세서 인식" file button →
  `uploadStatementImage` (maybeCompressImage → presign → S3 PUT, inline→dataURL fallback) → `/ocr` →
  prefills rows (receiptQty=receivedQty=명세서 수량, unitPrice) + supplier/date; `degraded`→수기 폴백 안내.
  lint+build pass. **Phase 4 COMPLETE** (stock-in API + form + 3-way + lotId + OCR).
- Next: Phase 6 — metrics (폐기율·폐기가액·사유 비중·입고 불일치율, byBranch). Then Phase 5
  (sheet sync + historical import) — build code but **STOP before live Google Sheets connection /
  import run** (needs Service Account + branchId-attribution decision; record request in HANDOFF).
- Pending human decisions (do NOT guess): branchId attribution for imported past rows; live Google
  Sheets connection + historical import run (approval-gated); 4-day window default.

## Done — CRM module (Ralph loop, 2026-06-15)

Building the Borough CRM + reservations module (`docs/templates-and-crm.md`) via a Ralph
loop driven by `ralph/PROMPT.md`. One bounded step per iteration on `feature/purchase-bot-mvp`.

- Iteration 1 (done): `Customer`/`Reservation` Prisma models (both schemas) + hand-written
  migration `20260615103000_add_crm_module`. **Migration NOT applied to prod** (`.env` points
  at Boro prod; applying needs explicit approval). No FK (PostTemplate convention).
  `prisma validate` + `generate` + `npm run lint` pass.
- Iteration 2 (done): module skeleton. `modules/crm/` with two manifests (crm→/work/customers,
  reservations→/work/reservations), stub dashboards, registered in `modules/registry.js`;
  route pages with `isModuleEnabled` brand guard. `npm run lint` + `next build` pass.
- Iteration 3 (done): lookup API `GET /api/work/crm/customers?q=`
  (`app/api/work/crm/customers/route.js`) — name/phone search → customer + reservationCount,
  totalAmount, recentReservations. Auth + `isModuleEnabled("crm")` guard + missing-table
  degrade-to-empty. Lint + build pass.
- Iteration 4 (done): real `/work/customers` screen (`modules/crm/ui/CustomersDashboard.jsx`,
  now a client component) — debounced name/phone search hitting the lookup API, customer cards
  with 단골 badge + counts, click-to-expand recent reservation history. Added CSS
  `.work-list/.work-list-row/.work-badge` in `app/globals.css`. Lint + build pass.
- Iteration 5 (done): reservations list API `GET /api/work/crm/reservations`
  (`app/api/work/crm/reservations/route.js`) — branchId/status/from/to filters → reservations
  with customerName + branchName, plus a `branches` list for the filter UI. Auth + brand guard
  + degrade. Lint + build pass.
- Iteration 6 (done): `/work/reservations` screen (`modules/crm/ui/ReservationsDashboard.jsx`,
  client component) — branch + status filters, summary metrics (count / total amount),
  pickup-date-sorted reservation table consuming the list API. Added `.work-filter-row` CSS.
  Lint + build pass. (Pickup calendar view split out as a later step.)
- Iteration 7 (done): reservation create API `POST /api/work/crm/reservations` (added to the
  same route file) — field validation → Customer upsert by phone + Reservation create
  (status 예약접수). No payment/external order; customer data only persisted, never logged.
  Missing-table → 503. Lint + build pass.
- Iteration 8 (done): reservation "새 예약" form on `/work/reservations` — typed fields +
  validation + customer-lookup autofill (debounced; click an existing customer to fill) +
  submit → POST + list reload. Added `.work-header-actions` CSS. Lint + build pass.

**Ralph loop OBJECTIVE complete (2026-06-15, 8 iterations).** Borough CRM + reservations
module shipped end-to-end on `feature/purchase-bot-mvp`: models + local migration, lookup API,
`/work/customers` search screen, `/work/reservations` list + 새 예약 form, reservation
create/list APIs, brand-gated. All iterations lint + build green; commits are local (not pushed).

- DEPLOYED to prod (2026-06-15, user-approved): migration `20260615103000_add_crm_module`
  applied to Boro prod (ref rodzysyxieneykcuokwh) via `prisma migrate deploy`; Vercel prod
  deploy `dpl_4kuqaGPSdpkomjt7VhwAqifUSvsc` (mattermost-project-mvp.vercel.app). Health ok /
  database ok; new CRM APIs return 401 unauthenticated; `/work/customers` + `/work/reservations`
  return 200. CRM features are now live for Borough; data appears as reservations are entered.
- PENDING: #배포로그 Ideas post (배포봇, `post-deploy-log-20260615-crm-module`) — held off
  (prod DB write beyond approved migration/deploy scope); create via app or with explicit ok.
- STILL OPEN: branchId attribution for the 20-month sheet import (decision needed before import).
- Beyond OBJECTIVE (future iterations): customer manual entry/edit, pickup calendar view,
  `@예약` channel entry point, metrics → 지점 인사이트, one-time sheet CSV import.
- NOTE: all CRM data screens stay empty until migration `20260615103000_add_crm_module` is
  applied to Boro prod (deferred, needs approval) and reservations are entered.
- Pending human action: apply `20260615103000_add_crm_module` to Boro prod when the CRM
  feature is ready to ship (and decide branchId attribution for the 20-month sheet import).

## Next Work

0-0. FIRST: discuss the usage-model rethink recorded in `TODO.md` ("Usage Model Rethink 2026-06-11") — channel = branch room + task = agent mention (fixes channel explosion), action-first work screens, intuitiveness quick wins. User wants the product to feel simple and intuitive as an ERP; get decisions, then fold into `docs/platform-architecture.md` and Phase 2 scope.

0. Platform architecture design approved 2026-06-10: `docs/platform-architecture.md` v2 (chat core / work modules / automation platform separation, UX standards, branch insights + metrics registry, agent-bot open platform plan). Decision recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. Remaining open items in doc section 16.
0-1. Before architecture Phase 1: apply employee UI/UX proposal (2026-06-10) per the "Today" section in `TODO.md` — readability, mention extension, pin, then search/threads/notifications. Reviewed as no structural conflict.
1. Push local commits before continuing from GitHub-only environments if needed.
2. Stabilize Coupang worker for:
   - existing cart items
   - multiple items
   - repeated URLs
   - quantity correction
   - cart row detection
3. Add first non-Coupang vendor workflow:
   - likely Sungwon Adpia skeleton first
4. Improve Agent/Bot admin UX:
   - installed agents
   - connected bots
   - channel-specific settings
   - vendor task status
5. Add external/team-built app registration skeleton after the admin UX is clearer.

## Team-Built Agent/Bot Framework Direction

The next implementation should make Chloris a small internal automation platform rather than a collection of hardcoded bots.

Target model:
- Team members can submit an agent/bot registration.
- Admin reviews and activates the app.
- Activated apps declare:
  - type: agent, bot, tool, webhook, local worker adapter
  - allowed events
  - required scopes
  - required configuration
  - credential requirements
  - audit log target
- Channels install agents first.
- Agent detail shows child tools/bots, so the channel UI does not become crowded.
- External apps use API tokens/webhooks only.
- Local worker bots use task queues and do not expose browser/session details to the server.

## Known Production Test Artifacts

- A first production test draft incorrectly included an `unknown` vendor line from `[운영 테스트] 2026-06-09 ...`.
- The parser fix was deployed, and a second production test confirmed:
  - line count: 2
  - `hasUnknown`: false
  - Coupang task status: `queued`
  - Sungwon Adpia task status: `vendor_bot_needed`

## Cautions

- Do not apply production DB migrations without explicit user approval.
- Do not send real emails without explicit user approval.
- Do not perform real payments.
- Do not delete production data without explicit user approval.
- Do not store raw secrets or sensitive data in docs.
- Debug Coupang automation only from artifacts, not selector guesswork.
- Keep deployment logs in the Ideas board for `#배포로그`.
